## TierRanking - JS App

### How does it work?

1. Create a category. 
2. Add items with names and images. 
3. Rank items in 6 different color-coded tiers.
4. See each item sorted into its respective category, with its rank displayed underneath its name.

### To get started

- Make sure the [backend Rails API](https://github.com/tsbrun/tier-ranking-backend) is up and running.
- Clone this repo to your machine.
- Use the command `open index.html` to run the app in your browser.
